# High School Website Called Amplifiable
This is website I created for my Communications Technology Course back in the 11th Grade at TL Kennedy Secondary 
School.

I created this website using Adobe Dreamweaver CS6. The flash involved was created using Adobe Flash CS4, and 
other graphics (buttons, lines....) were created using Adobe Photoshop CS2 & CC (because of different computers).

I created a website based on headphones because I love music, and I also love headphones. I love headphones for 
two reasons, first, headphones are portable, you can listen to music wherever you are. I love headphones because 
of that feature, their portability offers a huge advantage over normal speakers, although headphones may contain 
smaller components than normal speakers, they still are worth getting. Second, listening to music by using 
headphones offer a personal experience to enjoying music, it just feels more personal. Call me emotional but I 
when I listen to music by using headphones my feelings are more free to be "free". Thank you for reading, and I 
hope you enjoy having a look at my website.
